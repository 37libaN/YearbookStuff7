        <b>LEE-VE IT ALL BEHIND</b>- Daniel Lee (‘15), class treasurer, informs the class
        and the rest of the audience of the class gift. The class of 2015 voted to use the
        money they had raised over the past four years to replace the sound system of
        the Football field with a newer, higher-quality one.

        Waking up on graduation day is terrifying. Every senior knows that it’s
        the last day that he or she will ever be considered a high school student.
        After 7 years of seeing the same people, it’s daunting to think that
        graduation day is the last time the entire class of 2015 will be together,
        in the same room, in the same school. No matter how excited each
        person is to graduate and move on to bigger things, no one can help but
        feel a twinge of nostalgia the moment they enter the gym and realize
        that this - this understated gathering of parents in folding chairs and
        students in robes - is the end.
        “Waking up every morning and getting to spend eight hours a day
        with the people you love is something I will always cherish,” Michael
        Dobrzynski (‘15) recalled. “All of my friends... can’t believe how many
        memories we made.”
        When thinking back on graduation day, Grace Dunn (‘15)
        commented, “It was over. It was great to spend one last day with
        everyone, but then I realized. Seeing each other everyday? That
        wouldn’t happen anymore and it was sad.”
        After all, graduation day is the day that seniors become freshmen,
        high schoolers become college kids. “It was sad to think that at the
        end of the summer, I would be saying goodbye to everyone. I’ve been
        friends some people since second grade, and I watched them go off and
        start their new lives,” remembered Kaitlyn Peksa (‘15).
        Graduation day was the last day when the Class of 2015 were
        still seniors. It was the last time they would sit together as Brookfield
        Central students, as high schoolers. When the day was done, they
        would predict their future, see themselves moving on, and say goodbye
        to high school forever.

        <b>#SELFIE</b>- As class president Joey Baker (15’)
        stands in front of everyone giving his presidential declaration, many giggle and
        laugh as hundreds of selfies flip in the background. During graduation practice,
        Joey made a deal with Mr. Gruetzmacher, that if over 50% of the students
        tweeted a selfie then he would shave his head. Although the class exceeded
        their 50%, Mr. Gruetzmacher did not shave his head.

                down many different
                paths in our lives, we

        <b>A SPEECH WORTH SMILING FOR</b>- Lauren Chiang
        (‘15), the class’ vice president, smiles as she reviews the
        2015 seniors’ greatest memories in her speech. Even
        though only a small percentage of the graduates spoke
        at the podium, the vast majority would agree that the
        words spoken reflected the entire class. “The speeches
        were the most unforgettable part of graduation,” David
        Smith (‘15) recalled.
