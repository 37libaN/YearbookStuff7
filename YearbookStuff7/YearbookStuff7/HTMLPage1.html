    <p>     Waking up on graduation day is terrifying. Every senior knows that it’s
        the last day that he or she will ever be considered a high school student.
        After 7 years of seeing the same people, it’s daunting to think that
        graduation day is the last time the entire class of 2015 will be together,
        in the same room, in the same school. No matter how excited each
        person is to graduate and move on to bigger things, no one can help but
        feel a twinge of nostalgia the moment they enter the gym and realize
        that this - this understated gathering of parents in folding chairs and
        students in robes - is the end.
        “Waking up every morning and getting to spend eight hours a day
        with the people you love is something I will always cherish,” Michael
        Dobrzynski (‘15) recalled. “All of my friends... can’t believe how many
        memories we made.”
        When thinking back on graduation day, Grace Dunn (‘15)
        commented, “It was over. It was great to spend one last day with
        everyone, but then I realized. Seeing each other everyday? That
        wouldn’t happen anymore and it was sad.”
        After all, graduation day is the day that seniors become freshmen,
        high schoolers become college kids. “It was sad to think that at the
        end of the summer, I would be saying goodbye to everyone. I’ve been
        friends some people since second grade, and I watched them go off and
        start their new lives,” remembered Kaitlyn Peksa (‘15).
        Graduation day was the last day when the Class of 2015 were
        still seniors. It was the last time they would sit together as Brookfield
        Central students, as high schoolers. When the day was done, they
        would predict their future, see themselves moving on, and say goodbye
        to high school forever.
